You can open the app (for example in QtCreator) with the .pro file.
To make it work You need to create the "sounds" folder with Your .WAV files !!!

You can play/stop sounds chosen in the browser and also load the chosen sound to a specific track by 1/2/3/4 buttons.
When the sound is loaded to f.e. track 1, You can play it back with "1" key on Your keyboard.
